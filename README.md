Why this?
-------------

Every time you press return on your keyboard you're actually inserting an invisible character called a line ending. Historically, different operating systems have handled line endings differently.

When you view changes in a file, Git handles line endings in its own way. Since you're collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub, Git might produce unexpected results if, for example, you're working on a Windows machine, and your collaborator has made a change in OS X.

**Using** .gitattributes file you can overcome this problem most effectively. You can read more here https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/
